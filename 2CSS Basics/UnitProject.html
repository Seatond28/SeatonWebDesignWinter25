    <h1><header> Collecting Cards</header></h1>


    <p class="cards">I enjoy buying and collecting pokemon cards. As I contiune to spend money on good value cards I
        want to send
        them in
        to a grading company to get them graded to show the true value and if I should keep them or not. One of the
        most used and trusted companys for grading cards is PSA. If I ever were to have value in cards I would like
        to
        start reselling them so I can fund to buy more cards and repeat the process over again. I started collecting
        pokemon cards around 7 years ago when I went to summer camp and saw everyone else showing off their cool and
        colorful cards. Even after I stopped going there I still enjoyed opening cards and the dopamine I get from
        it. </p>

        <h1><header>Playing Pokemon TCG</header></h1>
        <p class="playing">
            Playing Pokemon TCG is when you build decks and actually use them to battle other people. When I used to go
            to summer camp I would have decks and so would my friends and we would spend a lot of our time battling each
            other. When battling there can be single or double battles with 2 or 4 people. Each person will have a deck
            of 60 cards max. At some retail stores like target and walmart they sell premade decks with all of the
            basics of playing the game given to you. If you're a person who collects a lot of cards though you can start
            to build your own deck that can be stronger than others because of the wide variety of options. As time goes
            on outdated cards start to become illegal to use when battling because of the chance of giving someone the
            upperhand. There is also a game centered around a differnt part of pokemon call pokemon TCG online where you
            use code cards found in pokemon packs and boxs and you can use those to get the same packs on the online
            game so you can play pokemon on the go.
