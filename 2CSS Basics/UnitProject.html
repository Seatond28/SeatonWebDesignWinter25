        <p class="cards">I enjoy buying and collecting pokemon cards. As I contiune to spend money on good value cards I want to send
            them in
            to a grading company to get them graded to show the true value and if I should keep them or not. One of the
            most used and trusted companys for grading cards is PSA. If I ever were to have value in cards I would like
            to
            start reselling them so I can fund to buy more cards and repeat the process over again. I started collecting
            pokemon cards around 7 years ago when I went to summer camp and saw everyone else showing off their cool and
            colorful cards. Even after I stopped going there I still enjoyed opening cards and the dopamine I get from
            it. </p>

        Playing Pokemon TCG is when you build decks and actually use them to battle other people.
