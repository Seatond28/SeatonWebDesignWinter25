    <h1>Chef: Making food professionally</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>A chef falls into the science of food</h2>
    <p>I want to be a chef because I want to be able to make my own food while also making it taste good.
        I want to be able to make food people enjoy and want again. I want to be a chef so I can pass down the skill of
        cooking my own food to my kids so they can make their own food instead of relying on fast food.
