        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am Dylan Seaton and I like to be active by playing sports or working out. I enjoy learning History
            and English because they work well together. As most athletic teenagers want I'd love to go pro in
            football but if that doesn't work out I would want
            to go to culinary school because I enjoy learning how to cook for myself and cooking in general. </p>

        <h1>The sports I Enjoy</h1>

            <li>Football.
                I like football because I play it and it is fun to watch.</li>
            <li>Golf.
                I like golf because I also play this but also because it is a different sport then what most people like
                to play or watch.</li>
            <li>Track and Field.
                I plan to run track and field and I like it becuase there is so many different events so it can unclude
                a lot of people.</li>
            <li>Basketball.
                I used to play basketball and it was enjoyable and it is fun watching the pros play because of all the
                skill they have.</li>
            <li>Hockey.
                I like to ice skate with friends and a lot of them play hokcey, hockey is also enjoyable because of the
                fights and aggresion shown in it that isn't allowed in most sports</li>
        </ol>
