    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am Dylan Seaton and I like to be active by playing sports or working out. I enjoy learning History 
        and English because they work well together. As most athletic teenagers want I'd love to go pro in 
        football but if that doesn't work out I would want 
        to go to culinary school because I enjoy learning how to cook for myself and cooking in general. </p>
