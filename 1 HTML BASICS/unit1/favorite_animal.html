            <h1> My favoirte animals are penguins </h1>
            <h2>Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Artcic mostly but will stray to other countries under the right circumstances.</h2>
            <hr>
            <h2>Penguins being flightless needed to find different ways to travel.</h2>
            <p>To travel differntly and quickly penguins started sliding on their stomachs, the ice 
                in the arctic being slippery helps the penguins with mobility and faster travel around their islands.
                Penguins travel 6 to 10 times faster on their stomachs than by just walking.
                When peguins slide on their stomachs it is usally called tobogganing or sleeding.
                Penguins also use sliding as a way to escape predators because of how much faster they move when sliding. 
                Because of their torpedo shaped bodies penguins like to slide on their stomachs into the water when they go hunting for small shrimp or krill
                when peguins slide into the water they propell themselves making the effort of swimming easier.

            <h2>Sometimes penguins get lonely.</h2>
            <p>When penguins get lonely they get depressed, they will swim to other islands or even different 
                countries looking for a mate to cure their loneliness.
                Penguins may also leave their homes in the Arctic if it becomes too cold for them to live or too hard to 
                find food, when this happens they usally 
                migrate to warmer climates and stay there adapting to the climate of this warmer place.
                There is a breed of penguins specifcally in Africa and mainly South Africa having adapted to the much warmer climate there.
