            <h2>Key Points</h2>
            <p>In conclusion to my presenation on the adoption of technology over the past century there have been many
                different important inventions that have been used to make the world a better place. One of the
                inventions being the Iphone which is what came after the cellphone making it able to do more things and
                giving you access to a hand held computer.</p>
